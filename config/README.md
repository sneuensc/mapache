In the config.yaml file you can find the parameters and options specified for each of the rules of mapache. These can be changed depending on specific needs.

Running mapache requires a reference genome. The path to the reference genome needs to be specified in the config/config.yaml file. All indexes of the reference genome are automatically computed if not already present.
